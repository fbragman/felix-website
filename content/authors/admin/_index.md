Hey! My name is Felix and I am currently a Senior Research Scientist in the AI Research Team at [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/ai/learn-more).

I am currently developing machine learning models for AI-driven healthcare. In particular, I am researching novel methods to learn patient representations from health records and for ensuring these representations generalise to unseen domains. I am also researching algorithms to learn modular and disentangled representations across a wide range of applications such as multi-task and continual learning. 

Before joining Babylon Health, I was a post-doc at UCL working with [M. Jorge Cardoso](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/jorge-cardoso) where I developed fundamental methods in deep learning and multi-task learning. I developed multiple learning schemes for multi-task learning, with oral presentations at [MICCAI 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06595.pdf) and [ICCV 2019](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Bragman_Stochastic_Filter_Groups_for_Multi-Task_CNNs_Learning_Specialist_and_Generalist_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf).

Previously, I was a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. David Hawkes](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=DJHAW78) at CMIC UCL and [Prof. John Hurst](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=JHURS15) at the Royal Free Hospital. I developed numerous algorithms for the quantitative analysis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) from three-dimensional Computed Tomography scans.
