Hey! My name is Felix and I am currently an Applied Scientist at Wayve working on efficient ML and foundational models for autonomous driving.

Previously, I was a Principal Engineer at Medtronic within the Surgical Robotics AI Centre of Excellence. I was the AI tech lead for the development of a real-time intraoperative surgical guidance model. I also led and conducted fundamental AI research for real-time AI models across efficient ML, long-context modelling, temporal multi-task learning and video instance segmentation. Before Medtronic, I was in the AI Research Team at Babylon Health where I was researching methods across GNNs and language models for learning patient representations from electronic health records.

I was a post-doc at UCL working with [M. Jorge Cardoso](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/jorge-cardoso) where I developed fundamental methods in deep learning and multi-task learning. I developed multiple learning schemes for multi-task learning, with oral presentations at [MICCAI 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06595.pdf) and [ICCV 2019](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Bragman_Stochastic_Filter_Groups_for_Multi-Task_CNNs_Learning_Specialist_and_Generalist_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf).

I initially was a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. David Hawkes](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=DJHAW78) at CMIC UCL and [Prof. John Hurst](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=JHURS15) at the Royal Free Hospital. I developed numerous algorithms for the quantitative analysis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) from three-dimensional Computed Tomography scans using supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
